# Exercise-02d-HUD-and-Levels

Test the game. You should be able to start the game, go to the second level, and then see the end-game screen when the health goes to zero.

Quit Godot. In GitHub desktop, you should now see the updated files listed in the left panel. In the bottom of that panel, type a Summary message (something like "Completes the game development") and press the "Commit to master" button. On the right side of the top, black panel, you should see a button labeled "Push origin". Press that now.

If you return to and refresh your GitHub repository page, you should now see your updated files with the time when they were changed.

Now edit the README.md file. When you have finished editing, commit your changes, and then turn in the URL of the main repository page (https://github.com/[username]/Exercise-02d-HUD-and-Levels) on Canvas.

The final state of the file should be as follows (replacing my information with yours):
